Installation on Ubuntu
======================

sudo apt-get install curl git-core build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm) Follow the instructions given by
this command. Usually it tells you to add a row in your .bash_profile.

source .bash_profile

rvm pkg install zlib
rvm install 1.9.2 # This step takes a while as it needs to compile Ruby.

rvm --default use 1.9.2

ruby -v and make sure you have version 1.9.2

install gems:
gem install cucumber crack httpclient capybara rspec

If you get problems with the zlib library when installing the gems do this:
rvm package install zlib (yes, install it again...)
rvm remove 1.9.2
rvm install 1.9.2 (yes install it again...)
